# 10. Proper C/C++ interoperability

## Overview

Ensure seamless interoperability between Fortran and C/C++ to allow Fortran
programs to effectively interact with a wide range of systems and libraries
written in other languages (e.g., high-performance environments).

## Checks

- _Planned: Encapsulate calls to external programming models in specific
  procedures or modules._
